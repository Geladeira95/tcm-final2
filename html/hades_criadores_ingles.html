                    Supergiant Games is an independent American studio founded by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon in 2009, with
                    the mission of creating games with a strong authorial identity. The studio gained recognition with
                    the release of Bastion in 2011, but it was with Hades, released in 2020, that it solidified its
                    place as one of the biggest names in the industry. Hades combines roguelike elements with a
                    high-quality cinematic narrative, set in the Greek underworld, where the player takes on the role of
                    Zagreus, the son of Hades, in his attempt to escape. The visual design, with its unique art style
                    and fluid animations, is complemented by the memorable soundtrack by Darren Korb, which enhances the
                    game's immersive experience.

                    Supergiant stands out for its ability to create rich universes, deep characters, and engaging
                    storylines. With Hades, the studio took this to new heights, winning both critical acclaim and
                    player admiration, and receiving numerous awards, including "Best Action Game" at The Game Awards
                    2020. The team's dedication to delivering an innovative and detailed experience made Hades a
                    landmark in the action game genre and a modern masterpiece.

                    the game captivated players by offering an intense experience and deep characters, particularly
                    highlighting Zagreus's relationship with the gods of the Greek underworld. The quality of the design
                    and the soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, was also widely praised.
